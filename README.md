# spl-6502 

A simple programming language for 6502 based machines with
Forth-like syntax

SPL-6502 is a Forth-style concatenative stack language. The compiler
is (currently) written in Python and emits 6502 assembly code.

Originally created by Ron Kneusel for the Apple II (original source
https://home.comcast.net/~oneelkruns/), adapted for the Atari 8bit and
enhanced by Carsten Strotmann (cas@strotmann.de).

SPL is still work-in-progress, it has many "rough-edges" and might
fail in certain places. It has many bugs. However, it works fine for
some developers.
